This is my recipe for chai, not to be confused with the chai-tea (latte). My version of tea is slightly over-boiled which lends it a strong flavor. To balance this deep flavor I suggest using milk with a decent amount of fat. This really works best with loose leaf black tea (any Indian brand actually) and grated ginger. If I'm feeling fancy I might add a couple of other spices (mentioned below).   

## Ingredients

- ½ cup water
- ½ cup milk
- 1 Tbsp loose leaf black tea
- ½ Tbsp grated ginger (for a less intense ginger flavor, slice instead of grating)
- 2 green cardamom pods
- (Some optional ingredients if you’re feeling fancy) cinnamon stick/ lemon grass stalk / a bay leaf
- Preferred sweetener to taste (optional)

## Instructions

- To a saucepan add crushed spices, water, and grated (or sliced) ginger and bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce heat slightly to medium.
- Add tea and milk of choice and lower heat to low. Cover and continue to simmer for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
- Then turn off the heat. Strain through a strainer and add your sweetener before serving.



This chai on a rainy day is truly a mood I hope you try if you haven't. You can't go wrong with pairing chai with almost anything- sweet or savoury.
