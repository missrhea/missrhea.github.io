My friend asked me if I had any New Year’s resolution in mind. It was the second week of December and I hadn’t given any thought to it yet. I took a couple seconds, then said my New Year’s resolution is to not make any New Year’s resolutions. Having participated in the whole ‘New Year New Me’ shenanigan for the last several years of my existence I decided that it was a sure fire way to feeling frustrated and disappointed. Even the numbers point to the staggering unsuccessfulness of New Year’s resolutions. One survey found that on average, only 9% of Americans were successful in keeping their resolutions1. Committing to something with a 91% rate of failure seems downright foolish. To avoid setting myself up for failure I decided to not play the game where the odds are so clearly not in my favour.


Now some might say that, the New Year is a time for hope and positive change. That having New Year’s resolutions is an opportunity to be better. And I agree with that, but only if your resolutions don’t fill you with dread when push comes to shove. There is a science to setting resolutions very much like there is science to motivation2. That means you could set approach-oriented goals instead of avoidance-oriented goals3, you could celebrate your successes4, you could change your environment, you could assign numbers to goals5, etc. My point is that there are these science backed strategies to succeed with New Year’s resolutions, in the case you decide to make some resolutions.


I’ll spare myself any new resolutions this January. That doesn’t mean I think I’m perfect or I think I don’t need to change. In 2023, I hope to continue doing some things that have been good for me lately and discontinue other unhelpful things. For example, I like how much I’ve been reading and I hope to continue that. I don’t like how little I’ve been writing here so I hope to change that. I hope to continue trying to be better and embracing the ups and downs as they inevitably will come.


Whether you decide to set New Year’s resolutions or not, either way it’s a wonderful time to be hopeful. Hope is a beautiful thing of the human imagination. And I hope we all hold on to it.
