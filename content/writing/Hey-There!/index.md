Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

Iâ€™ve been working on building this website for a while. Although I will continue to make updates to the style and structure, Iâ€™m finally putting it out there. I actually enjoyed designing and builing this website because I got to revisit web development- which is a skill I abandoned for a while. What pulled me through was the copious amount of tea (read: [chai](https://rhearodrigues.me/How-I-make-tea/)) and baked treats I had on the side.

This is where I plan to share a little bit of what Iâ€™m up to. Iâ€™m going to keep this one short, so thank you for stopping by, and maybe Iâ€™ll see you here again soon.
