Waking up at 7 AM on a Saturday to drive 2 hours away from the city to go climb a mountain is one of the best things I know. I did my first hike of the summer last weekend and I had the best time. On the drive back I was reflecting on the things that make hiking enjoyable. Of course it’s the things like your endurance and stamina, preparedness for weather changes, familiarity with the trails, and all the other information hiking blogs will let you know.

Now, there’s one thing that these hiking blogs don't talk about, which I believe is essential to enjoy any hike: the people who are on this adventure <i>with</i> you. The individuals you will spend the next few hours, and possibly even days with. The people who signed up to navigate this challenging and precarious terrain alongside you. When you're on the trails, vulnerable to the elements of nature, the company you keep can make a significant difference. I’ve hiked the same trail with a different group of people each time, and each time the group dynamic has influenced how much fun I had.

All of my favourite hikes have been with people who share one key attribute: empathy. The ability to understand another person's situation and adjust oneself to meet them where they are. I have been fortunate to be on the receiving end of empathy on my most challenging hikes. There were people who could have easily been miles ahead but decided to stick by my side, even when I was slowing them down. They were encouraging, kind, and patient, making me feel like they believed I could do this difficult thing. These individuals turned the most demanding hikes into some of my best experiences. Some of them became good friends who I still hike with. Some of them I fondly think about when I look at old pictures. Either way, I wouldn't be able to call myself the someone who loves to hike without crossing paths with these awesome people.

I did my first hike of the season last weekend, and boy, was I out of shape. But as I said, I get by with a little help from my friends.
