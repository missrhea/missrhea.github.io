Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Iâ€™m using Gatsby as the static site generator and GitHub pages for hosting this website. Iâ€™ve been working on setting up this website for a while and Iâ€™m finally putting it out here. It was kind of fun because I sipped on copious amounts of tea and nibbled on cookies and bar cakes. I learned a couple things on the way. Iâ€™m more sure than not about how this website is presently set up. I might have to tweak something at some point. Right now Iâ€™m content to start from here.

This is where I plan to share a little bit of what Iâ€™m up to. Iâ€™m going to keep this one short, so thank you for stopping by, and maybe Iâ€™ll see you here again soon.
