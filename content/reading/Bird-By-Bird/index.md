I keep visiting this book. I know I need to write a review, but words to describe it escape me. Which is ironic because this is a book about writing which said so much so beautifully that I am at a loss of words. But to say this is a book about writing is unfair, it is so much more. And one day I will write complete this review. Lamott compels me to write, helps me understand the need to write, the value in writing, and sets an example for what good writing is- which I would be foolish to attempt. I will not stop thinking about this special book.
