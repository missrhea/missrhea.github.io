I keep visiting this book. I know I need to write a review, but words to describe it escape me. Which is ironic because this is a book about writing which said so much so beautifully that I am at a loss of words. But to say this is a book about writing is unfair, it is so much more. I will not stop thinking about this book. And one day I will write this review, or about reviews. Lamott compels me to write, helps me understand the need to write, the benefits of writing, and sets an example for what good writing is.
