This book is replete with complicated business decisions, negotiations, and the constant strive to grow and stay successful- that the author conveys in the form of his conversations with Steve Jobs, mentors, leaders, and investment bankers and sometimes with himself on a daily 90-minute drive to work. 

This book strikes a great balance between technicalities of business and creativity which made it insightful and heartening at once. The author writes about complex business deals and power dynamics and explains them in an entertaining and engaging way.

I now have a soft spot for the author- it turns out that some corporate lawyers turned CFOs are nice at heart and some even help save an iconic computer animation company and even care deeply about its employees. I have also come to view Steve Jobs in a fond new light. I’ll have a feeling I might be re-reading this.
