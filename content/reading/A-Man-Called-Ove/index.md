This book is about an elderly man, Ove, who lives in Sweden. Fredrik Backman artfully puts Ove across as the curmudgeon old man in the neighborhood. At the start of the story, I was frustrated with Ove and quickly associate him with a curmudgeon we all know. But as soon as you decide this, the author cleverly brings to light all of the past life experiences and circumstances that have made Ove the man he is today. 

At this point I realized I was too quick to judge- even a fictional character. And you find yourself sympathetizing with Ove. By the end of the book, Ove had become one of my most memorable and lovable fictional characters. Overall, it was a lovely read.
