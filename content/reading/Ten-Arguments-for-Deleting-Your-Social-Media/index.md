<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3010868.Jaron_Lanier">Lanier's</a> criticism of social media is compelling and should be required reading for everybody. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38122464-ten-arguments-for-deleting-your-social-media-accounts-right-now">Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now</a> is well-researched, urgent, and well-intentioned. I urge you to pick this book up, read it with careful consideration, and use it to determine your relationship with social media going forward. 

Personally, I have several reasons for giving up most of my social media use and controlling the social media I continue to use, but the bottom line is that it made me <i>feel bad</i>- I realized I had to remove myself from that situation. Some might say this reaction is too strong. To that, I say perhaps your capacity for tolerating it is better than mine. 

Nevertheless, Lanier presents arguments that go beyond the personal realm. He examines the ramifications on society for generations if we don't pressurize the incumbent organizations to shift their business models to ones capable of operating without necessary behavior modification. If you want to do a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8430423/social-media-teachers-students-youth">hurting society</a> some good evaluate your dynamic with social media and start with this book.

A friend had mentioned one of Lanier's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget">books</a> in the past. When I saw this book on the first shelf in the library I <i>had</i> to pick it up, and I'm so glad I did.
