I listened to the audiobook version narrated by the author herself and it felt like a conversation with a friend that ended too soon. She talks about the joys of reading and the miseries of being a reader. She talks about that singular book that made you absolutely love reading not because the book was a classic or popular or critically acclaimed, but simply because you were compelled to find out what happens next. She draws parallels in how enthusiastically imposing a book you loved onto someone can be the same as unsolicited advice- both are unwelcome and unhelpful. In another chapter, she talks about the authors who earn their readers' tears. And I could not agree more, I adore those stories because I love myself a well-earned sob story. 

Above all else this book made me feel validated as the reader I am. I might not read as much as to label myself a bookworm. And that is okay. I can be a voracious reader whenever I find "the" book for me.
