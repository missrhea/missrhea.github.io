This is a story in verse form narrated by a father who is hoping his son will find refuge on the other side of the Mediterranean sea. The story is inspired by Alan Khurdi, the three-year-old boy who drowned on this journey.
The father makes an effort to remind his son about how wonderful his hometown used to be. But the son was too young to remember these memories. The son only knows of destruction and bloodshed. The father says a sea prayer as his son escapes on a boat.
The verses in the book have been illustrated in a watercolor-esque style. The changing color scheme as you progress through the verses comes across well. Starting with warm tones as the father recalls his fond boyhood memories it progresses to dark cool tones as his son sets out to sea.
