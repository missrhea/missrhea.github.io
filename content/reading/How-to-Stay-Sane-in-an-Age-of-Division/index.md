When I came across this title on the library shelf it seemed like it might be a helpful read. The book was published in August 2020. So for me, a lot of the ideas in here were not new- thanks to the viral nature of popular culture ideas on social media. Which is primarily the reason why I didn't love it. I might have had a different opinion is I picked it up in 2020. I wanted to abandon the book multiple times, but because it was relatively short at just under 100 pages I just got on with it.
