# üöÄ Summary
Oranges is a coming-of-age story about a lesbian girl who grows up in a small-town English Pentecostal community. She is brought up by an overly religious God-fearing mother. Jeanette is convinced her destiny is to become a missionary, but then one day she falls for another girl. While Jeanette is coming to terms with her preference for her own sex, she and her partner are found out and subjected to exorcisms by the religious community. In spite of being subjected to public humiliation, considered possessed, and being treated like an outcast she grows up to define her relationship with God on her own terms.

Whether this is autobiographical to any degree or just a literary device Oranges is tragic, comic, and clever. Winterson examines themes like organized religion, difficult family relationships, same-sex relationships, and the transition from youth to adulthood.   

# üé® Impressions
The book is divided into 8 chapters each named after the first eight books in the Old Testament and includes references from the corresponding Biblical books. The final chapter corresponds to the book of Ruth. This is clever because the lesson in Ruth is that humans naturally find love and family connections wherever they are, irrespective of ethnicity and faith. The main plot is clear and interspersed with short stories that seem inspired by Fairy Tales and Biblical stories.

It was a quirky heartfelt story that I breezed through in two days.
