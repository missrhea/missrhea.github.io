I love myself a good memoir. Memoirs are my favorite kind genre. Phil Knight's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27220736-shoe-dog">Shoedog</a>, J.R. Moehringer's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144977.The_Tender_Bar">The Tender Bar</a>, and so <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/92922919?shelf=memoirs">many more</a> have made an indelible mark on me. In fact, I should look up how highly I've rated books by genre. My first book of the new year was a memoir, specifically a celebrity memoir. I am cautious of celebrity memoirs and usually tend to steer clear of them. 

I stumbled onto this book thanks to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I2R9jF0DvHYl0HFiWx9Ut?si=E9lxf_TkRly6rayeYMNLUQ">this episode of The Book Review</a>. The hosts discuss the problem with celebrity memoirs is that it is more often than not ghostwritten. These ghostwriters are undoubtedly talented but often they don't succeed in capturing the celebrity's true voice. And I can see how this glaring lack of authenticity makes the enterprise seems more of a publicity stunt than anything else. However, sometimes collaborations with ghostwriters work really well and allows for a great memoir. The podcast hosts mentioned Molly Shannon's collaboration with Sean Wilsey as one of those great memoirs.

I knew nothing about Molly Shannon, but I trust the New York Times so I downloaded the audiobook just as they recommended. And I have to say I absolutely loved it. I laughed and cried and my heart broke and my heart yearned, basically, I felt all the feelings. Shannon narrated the book herself which is a treat, she's got a distinct voice that I can still hear even one week after I completed the audiobook. Shannon's story starts off with a tragedy that remains with her but she doesn't it define her. A large part of the book is about her dad, the complexity of that relationship, and how each of them admired the other. Molly has this wild spirit in adolescence that she carries into her adult life, and I love that her father encouraged and supported that sort of non-conformity to society and to rules. It made me happy to know that Molly was free to be who she was instead of who she had to be. Shannon's story is entertaining and ultimately uplifting, and one that I recommend getting the audiobook for.
