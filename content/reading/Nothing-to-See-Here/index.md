# 🚀 Summary
In <i>Nothing To See Here</i> Wilson examines themes like finding meaning, parenting, the need to be understood. 10-year-old twins- Bessie and Roberts- spontaneously combust when upset or angry. After their mother's sudden death, the twins move in with their father, senator Jasper Roberts, and stepmother, Madison. Because flammable kids are a big no to the senator and his aspiration to be president, Madison calls on her long-lost best friend, Lillian, to be a governess. Lillian and Madison were close in school, but now Lillian is a bit of an oddball. She decides being a paid governess could not be worse than her present financially and emotionally insecure existence. After initial conflict and misunderstandings, Lillian earns their trust and they find a sense of belonging in each other. 

# 🎨 Impressions
I listened to the audiobook. It's an endearing and amusing story that I breezed through in two days. Wilson keeps you engaged and entertained- in spite of a somewhat predictable end. And I really enjoyed reading David's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3260736650?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">review</a>.

# ✍️ My Favorite Quotes
> “The kids were happy. They had added another to their numbers. They didn't want to set the world on fire. They just wanted to be less alone in it.”

> “This was what I finally realized, that even as we sank deeper and deeper into our lives, we were always separate. And I wondered what it would feel like, to fall but to hold on to someone else so you weren’t alone.”

> “I'm not joking when I say that I never liked people, because people scared me. Because anytime I said what was inside me, they had no idea what I was talking about. They made me want to smash a window just to have a reason to walk away from them. Because I kept fucking up, because it seemed so hard not to fuck up, I lived a life where I had less than what I desired. So instead of wanting more, sometimes I just made myself want even less. Sometimes I made myself believe that I wanted nothing, not even food or air. And if I wanted nothing, I'd just have to turn in to a ghost. And that would be the end of it.”
