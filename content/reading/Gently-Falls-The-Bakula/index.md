<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152194-tiny-beautiful-things?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=QhDs1Wg55b&rank=1">Gently Falls The Bakula</a> is a criticism of modern values and work-ethic, patriarchy, and discrimination conveyed through an unassumingly, endearing but moving plot. Murty writes without fuss and despite the simplicity, it is evocative.  

A friend recommended this book. I read it on a 15-hour long flight swapping it every now and then for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92922919-rhea#">The Little Prince</a>, meals, and naps. I couldn't wait to land so I could look up a picture of the Bakula flower and confirm whether or not I had seen it before- I hadn't. Gently Falls The Bakula is more than a cozy story, it reminded me of an important lesson- to choose for ourselves what brings meaning to our life and pursue that whole-heartedly. This quote sums it up.

"'Shrimati, what are you thinking of?' 'My loneliness. Sometimes it is very depressing.' 'Shrimati, may I give you some advice? Hope you will not mind. One should have the basic happiness within oneself. That happiness comes from the kind of work one does whole-heartedly.'"
