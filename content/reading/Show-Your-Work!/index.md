This book made me see why not putting my work out there was not an option anymore. It hugely motivated this blog.


### How the Book Changed Me:

- It made me more **comfortable with sharing** my thoughts and my work online.
- I plan to write and publish articles and **stop being afraid** of what "some" people might think, there is surely someone who will benefit from my work- and I will think of these people.
- Self-promotion matters. Period. And I plan to **advocate for and promote myself** (because if I don't then nobody will).


### My Top 3 Takeaways:

- I had a professor in college who returned our graded essays, walked up to the chalkboard, and wrote in huge letters: **“SO WHAT?”** She threw the piece of chalk down and said, “Ask yourself that every time you turn in a piece of writing.” It’s a lesson I never forgot. Always be sure to run everything you share with others through The “So What?” Test.
- If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one.
- The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online.** Use pictures, words, and video. Take people step-by-step through part of your process. As blogger Kathy Sierra says, **“make people better at something they want to be better at”
