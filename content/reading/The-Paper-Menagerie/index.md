This is a very short story about the relationship between a young man who was born to a native Chinese mother and an American father. The mother's Chinese traditions begin to cause her young son embarrassment and as a result their relationship suffers. It is heart-breaking to watch this unfold. 

This story shines a light on some universal emotions we can relate to as a result of our shared human experience. In particular, shame, frustration, rejection, guilt, and regret. Depending on at what stage of life you are at you might empathize with the son's or the mother's predicament- or both.
