<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60657583-lucy-by-the-sea">Lucy by the Sea</a> begins at the onset of the 2020 pandemic. Our protagonist Lucy Barton is whisked away from her home in Manhattan to a small town in Maine by her ex-husband William. We follow Lucy Barton as she navigates the new world under lockdown, her anxiety, living in a small house with William, a tense relationship with her daughters, and the many forms of grief that the pandemic showed us.

I enjoyed the first person narration and getting to know our protagonist. To be inside Lucy Barton's head and watch the world from her perspective was interesting. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/97313.Elizabeth_Strout">Strout's</a> writing is simple, anthentic and it's very stream-of-consiousness writing and hence very in the moment. More than anything, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60657583-lucy-by-the-sea">Lucy by the Sea</a> reminded me that I lived through that pandemic too, and that was a difficult thing for all of us collectively. We got through a really difficult time. I remember wondering, the next time I was on the subway, what these people must have gone through back then? What they must be going through now? If anything, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60657583-lucy-by-the-sea">Lucy by the Sea</a> renewed my sense of empathy for all of us.

Here are some of my highlights.
<i>
> “...This had often broken my heart, to realize that you never know the last time you pick up a child. Maybe you say "Oh, honey, you're getting too big to be picked up" or something like that. But then you never pick them up again.”

> “And when I found out that I had been living a parallel life, a dishonest life, it crushed me. But I have often thought that it made me a nicer person, I really do. When you are truly humbled, that can happen. I have come to notice this in life. You can become bigger or bitter, that is what I think. And as a result of that pain, I became bigger. Because I understood then how a woman could not know. It had happened, and it had happened to me.”

> “Here is what I did not know that morning in March: I did not know that I would never see my apartment again. I did not know that one of my friends and a family member would die of this virus. I did not know that my relationship with my daughters would change in ways I could never have anticipated. I did not know that my entire life would become something new.”
