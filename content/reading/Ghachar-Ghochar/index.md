The book follows a Kannada family on the brink of destitution as they navigate newfound wealth. And the new money tears this family apart. It shifts family dynamics and self-perceptions. It's a social commentary on just how uncomfortable discussing money can be. There are some uncomfortable conversations where Shanbag captures this palpable tension in the room with mastery. And he will leave you to grapple with an unsettling conclusion.

With just under 120 pages <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30267604-ghachar-ghochar">Ghachar Ghochar</a> has an energy that transported me to a different time and place. It is powerful, beautiful, and masterful. And in that regard, this novella is the perfect recipe for escapism. I recommend reading it in one sitting if you can.
