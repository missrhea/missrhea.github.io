Did I just read another celebrity memoir? Just within two weeks of finishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Shannon">Molly Shannon's</a> <a href="https://rhearodrigues.me/Hello-Molly/">Hello Molly!</a> Now, I do try to consciously diversify across genres when I read. But I have a soft spot for memoirs. More so when that memoir involves the boy who played my ten year old self's love interest, especially when he narrates it himself.

In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61062194-beyond-the-wand">Beyond the Wand</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TomFelton">Felton</a> recounts several anecdotes from his early years, as a <i>cocky</i> (as he likes to say) teenage boy on the film set and off the film set. Most of the anecdotes are downright hilarious. On the audiobook, each time he chuckles at the memory of his boyhood escapades I melt- I mean my ten year old self melts. It turns out that he was a perfect Draco- snarky and world-weary. His anecdotes about actors and professionals he worked with throughout those early years were a welcome dose of nostalgia.

The last third of the book is different. I was enjoying myself so far in the book but the last third cemented by love for this book and for the author. <a href="https://twitter.com/TomFelton">Felton</a> is transparent and vulnerable. I was not expecting the unfiltered raw honesty. He talks about mental health with distinct empathy. I will be replaying the final chapter 27 pretty soon. This part of the book is his attempt to destigmatize rehab, therapy, medication, and most importantly his attempt to normalize the unease of feeling <i>bad</i>. We all go through bouts of feeling bad from time to time, in those moments knowing that you're not alone can mean a lot. I am grateful for his openness and I admire <a href="https://twitter.com/TomFelton">Felton</a> for it.

One thing that struck me was his acknowledgement of how powerful it is to be able to help others, as a tool to take care of one's mental health. I've experienced the immediate shift in my mood when I know that I was of help- that's the closest I've come to real magic. 

I think this is one of those times when experiencing the audiobook is superior to reading the book. If you are a fan, you will love it. If you're not a fan, give it a try, this story might just turn you into one.  

Some quotes I liked from the book.
* "Helping others is a powerful weapon in the fight against mood disorders."

* “The only true currency we have in life is the effect we have on those around us.” 

* "To this day I never know which version of myself I’m going to wake up to. It can happen that the smallest chores or decisions—brushing my teeth, hanging up a towel, should I have tea or coffee—overwhelm me. Sometimes I find the best way to get through the day is by setting myself tiny, achievable goals that take me from one minute to the next. If you sometimes feel like that, you are not alone, and I urge you to talk about it to someone. It’s easy to bask in the sun, not so easy to enjoy the rain. But one can’t exist without the other. The weather always changes. Feelings of sadness and happiness deserve equal mental screen time."
