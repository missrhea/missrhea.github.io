Read this book felt like Phil Knight is my buddy. I found it relatable. The end of the book is my favourite part, it's written by someone who sounds much more mature than the Phil Knight in the earlier chapters of the book. I also enjoyed the chronological chapters. I learned so much about America, Japan and China in the second half of the twentieth century.
