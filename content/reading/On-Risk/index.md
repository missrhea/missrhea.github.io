# üöÄ Summary
Kingwell is a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto. In this short pocket-sized book Kingwell examines risk, how society should manage and distribute risk with a focus on the covid-19 era. This book is so short yet I had a hard time summarizing it. But I will update this review when I get to summarizing it.

# üé® Impressions
Right off the bat the book is not easy reading. One of the reviews on the cover says "Kingwell is well-read, a gifter notice, a lively writer...." and I could not agree more. The footnotes were interesting and I think this might be the only book where I read all the footnotes. Although I learned a about risk, luck, and politics of risk I also learned a lot about the author's likes and dislikes- which frankly made the book a bit more interesting.
