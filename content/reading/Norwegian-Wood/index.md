This book is plain sad. I remember trying to read it last year, but I couldn't go through with it at that time. This time around I completed it. 
The book is full of raw emotions and the author writes very simply about coming to terms with one's sexuality. This book is also about death, but not the dead. It is rather about how the living must come to grips with the dead being dead and muster the strength, courage and show up to live life.
This line mentioned in the book sums it up well, "death is not the opposite of life but a part of it".
