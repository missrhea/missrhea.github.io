Lydia lives in the Mexican city of Acapulco with her son Luca and her husband who is a journalist. Lydia comes to know a man who is unbeknownst to her a drug lord who controls Acapulco. The subsequent revelations kick off Lydia and Luca's attempt to flee to America.

From this point on I found myself transported beside Lydia and her eight-year-old son Luca, as they desperately fled the city of Acapulco. I could feel the adrenaline Luca must have felt when they jumped onto the first moving train, the thrill of riding atop the train, the burden of always being wary of everyone, and all the times they experienced paralyzing fear, hopeless despair but always managed to escape death by narrow margins. The author artfully captures Lydia's motherly instincts and at the same time is able to maintain her individuality. While I would not go so far as to call this book a thriller it certainly was a page-turner.

I began to read this book oblivious to the contention surrounding it. As someone not aware of what life is for migrants, this book was enlightening. As a work of fiction this is a great story, perhaps this book should not have been touted in the manner that it was.
