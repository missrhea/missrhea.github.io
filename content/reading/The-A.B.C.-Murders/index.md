***Disclaimer: This is not a review***

We're in a pandemic right now and everyday life feels unreal, strange and unfamiliar. I haven't been homesick at all. But the thought of not being able to go home indefinitely makes me homesick.

In an attempt to find some comfort I've been rereading some of my favorite Agatha Christie books these past few weeks. The A.B.C. Murders was my first Agatha Christie mystery novel. I still remember the day I borrowed it from my classmate Shagun. I'm not going to review this book. But it is one of my favourite Poirot murder mystery’s.
