I remember that I started reading the book, but I could not go through with it. Then I switched to the audiobook version which was not as much of a drag- thanks to 2X speed.

I found it hard to relate to Philpott's narritive throughout the book. But there were some moments I did feel like, damn me too! I listened to the audiobook which I very much enjoyed because Philpott adds sassiness and sarcasm that makes the subjects of the book seem fun and like you're listening to a friend share their frustration and then console themself.
