The plot is stellar and comes together in the end with a surprise and a shock. Even though the cast has a few too many characters it was not too hard to follow and Poirot marvelously elicits the truth from each one of them and artfully ties together characters with concealed relationships. I could not have gotten to the end of this story fast enough!
