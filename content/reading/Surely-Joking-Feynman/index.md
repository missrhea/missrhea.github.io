# 🚀 Summary

This is a collection of personal anecdotes by Feynman. He's lived a rather colorful life. He is brilliant, is well-traveled, experienced different cultures, experienced a war-time USA- all of which makes this a wonderful memoir.
The man's a genius but that doesn't stop him from acknowledging his mistakes and his failures.
He is a real showman. He develops this knack for drumming, Portuguese, breaking the code on locks, being a ladies' man (for lack of a better term), drawing, and odd talents like these that keep him the life of the party.

# 🎨 Impressions

This was a delightful read! I listened to the audiobook which was very well produced and accentuated the sarcasm and annoyance in Feynman's narrative.
Sure Feynman was a genius, he won the Nobel Prize after all. He was also charmingly boyish and downright mischievous. Themes that seem to be constant throughout his book. He might come across as self-aggrandizing and narcissistic if you take the book too seriously. I almost fell for that trap myself. Then the title reminded me that you can't take things too seriously.
His spirit of curiosity and inquiry is truly inspiring. Not only does this translate into his approach to learning but more notably it translated into how he taught others to think. The inspiring gift of how to think is perhaps almost as significant as any of his contributions to physics.

# ✍️ My Favorite Quotes

> “You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.”

> “I didn't want to do the drumming if I was doing it because as Samuel Johnson said "If you see a dog walking on his hind legs, it's not so much that he does it well as that he does it at all".”

> “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that.”

> “You see, I get so much fun out of thinking that I don’t want to destroy this pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick.”
