# üöÄ Summary
>The boy is full of questions
>The mole is greedy for cake
>The fox is mainly silent and wary because he's been hurt by life.
>The horse is the biggest thing they've ever encountered, and also the gentlest.

A lonely boy befriends a mole, a fox and a horse. Together they learn who they are and who they want to become and, in doing so, explore the feelings and thoughts that unite us all.

# üé® Impressions
A easy comforting read for a hard day. It‚Äôs written in a children‚Äôs book format complete with lovely illustrations. Turns out children‚Äôs books have the most greatest life lessons which are also the simplest ones. This one is a story about friendship, kindness for yourself and others, and gratitude- all the good stuff we need to be reminded of every now and then.

[This](https://youtu.be/81b4i9jQhck) free audiobook production on YouTube is lovely to listen to. So if you got 12 minutes to spare on a afternoon give this a watch.

# üïµ How I Discovered It
On my internship I had a coffee chat with a really senior Director, I asked for a bunch of their favorite books. This was one of them.

# ‚úçÔ∏è My Favorite Quotes

I need to be reminded of this multiple time a day.
>‚ÄúWhat do you think is the biggest waste of time?"
>"Comparing yourself to others", said the mole.‚Äù

This one spread a smile across my face.
>‚ÄúWhat is the bravest thing you've ever said? asked the boy.
>'Help,' said the horse.
>'Asking for help isn't giving up,' said the horse. 'It's refusing to give up.‚Äù

And this one made me almost tear-up.
>‚ÄúSo you know all about me?' asked the boy.
>'Yes.' said the horse.
>'And you still love me?'
>'We love you all the more.‚Äù
