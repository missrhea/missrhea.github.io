After reading Normal People- which I enjoyed- and then coming to this book I can see what Rooney does really well. She captures the deeply hurt feelings of scared adults with a kind of melancholic mood that looms throughout the telling of the story. And I'm not into young adult content at this point in time, but Rooney's work makes me wish it was available some ten years earlier. 

The <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11997646/">Hulu series</a> adaptation starring Joe Alwyn comes out in May so I <i>had</i> to finish reading this one soon. I have been in a reading slump this April. Actually, I read fewer books and a lot of short pieces on the internet. <a href= "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32187419-conversations-with-friends">Conversations with Friends</a> was a great pick me up to get back into reading books- even though I listened to the audiobook.
