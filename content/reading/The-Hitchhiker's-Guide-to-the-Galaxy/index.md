I got my Lasik surgery done so I was not going to be able to open my eyes for the next 48 hours. I kick started my audiobook marathon with this series.

I enjoyed the audiobook production of this book narrated by Stephen Fry. Each character is truly brought to life with their personalities and sense of humour. The jokes are thoughtful and in general the book is a superbly fun read. The book is scattered with thought provoking statements to make you wonder "What if?". Overall, it's a weird little story about the absurdity of life.
