Obviously, like most books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6294.Howl_s_Moving_Castle">Howl’s Moving Castle</a> is not for everyone. But I haven't read anything as magical and fantastical as this story in many many years, reading this was a pure feel-good dose of comforting nostalgia.  I read almost all of this book every night before I slept.  It is the book I know I would have devoured at age 10. But <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4260.Diana_Wynne_Jones">Jones</a> writes for all ages, in fact, at some points I was thinking about how cool it would be to someday read this with my own children.

This year I wanted to read books that I wouldn't have gravitated to naturally. So when it came to fantasy, I had to trust my friend who is a voracious consumer of the genre. And one of the books she suggested I get started with was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6294.Howl_s_Moving_Castle">Howl’s Moving Castle</a>. I'm terribly nervous and excited to Watch studio Ghibli's film adaptation.
