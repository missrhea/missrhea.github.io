<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six">Daisy Jones & The Six</a> was a phenomenal summer read. It has these incredible empowering dynamic female characters, tells a moving story about living with addiction and living as a recovering addict, and of course this compelling 70s rock music landscape. It's written in a unique interview format in which characters take turns recounting their version of past events, and you begin to empathize with them and see these different perspectives. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6572605.Taylor_Jenkins_Reid">Reid's</a> execution of this format along with solid character development for every single character is excellent, even the supporting characters have way more depth here than is usually afforded to them.

I was immediately swept away into the world Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne existed in. The audiobook has a stellar cast each with distinct voices that made it a truly immersive experience. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6572605.Taylor_Jenkins_Reid">Reid's</a> mastery over the 70's era rock music landscape and song-writing shines throughout the book. There is barely a dull moment at all. All along I kept wishing this would have been non-fiction so that I could listen to the songs. So it's great news that it's being <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwilwLOmzJL6AhXCIzQIHSZ1Dw0QFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDaisy_Jones_%2526_The_Six&usg=AOvVaw2PBJ0kWvhYp1P6DvV12Lbk">adapted to into an Amazon Prime miniseries</a> soon!

It was my first time reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6572605.Taylor_Jenkins_Reid">Reid</a>, and even though this book was highly loved I treaded cautiously. I half expected a narrative involving a gorgeous incredibly talented singer thrown into a six-member rock band, interlaced with drugs and sex to come across as banal, half-baked, and cocky. But I'm very happy that I was wrong. It was a great audiobook to have for the commute to the office (yes I've been going to an actual office).

And now here are some of my favorite lines.
> "Men often think they deserve a sticker for treating women like people." 

> "I think you have to have faith in people before they earn it. Otherwise it's not faith, right?"

> "You have these lines you won’t cross. But then you cross them. And suddenly you possess the very dangerous information that you can break the rule and the world won’t instantly come to an end. You’ve taken a big, black, bold line and you’ve made it a little bit gray. And now every time you cross it again, it just gets grayer and grayer until one day you look around and you think, There was a line here once, I think."

> "Passion is...it's fire. And fire is great, man. But we're made of water. Water is how we keep living. Water is what we need to survive."

> "The only reason people thought I had everything is because I had all the things you can see. I had none of the things you can't."
