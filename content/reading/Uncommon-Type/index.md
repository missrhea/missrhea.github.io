This book is a collection of short stories. I wish I enjoyed this book more than I did. I found most stories to be flat, with no overarching narrative to motivate me to flip to the next page. Perhaps I should have opted for the audiobook for a better experience.

Although some of the stories have sentimental value, the others were just bland. I certainly enjoy watching Tom Hanks in movies over reading his short stories.
