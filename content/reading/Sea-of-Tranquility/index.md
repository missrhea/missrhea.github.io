I've been wanting to read Mandel forever. And I picked up her lastest, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=9mU5sxB6rS&rank=3">Sea of Tranquility</a> with the most gorgeous cover art. Let me tell you that I haven't read a book as compulsively or as quickly as I did with this in a very long time. I love that the one scene holding this story together takes place in Vancouver Island because having been there several times I can fully appreciate the eerie mood Mandel conjures.

Mandel seems to thrive in the space where surrealism and the ordinary meet. To that extent Sea of Tranquility is science fiction that weaves time-travel and outer-space colonies with plage and war. For a novel that is set across time and space Mandel's writing is sharp from beginning to end- she rarely falters in holding the reader's attention. She takes you on this epic saga in a mere 255 pages- that is an incredible feat.

A couple of weeks before I picked up the book, I listened to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ma/podcast/emily-st-john-mandel-on-time-travel-parenting-and/id1548604447?i=1000558357715">this podcast</a> with Mandel which I thought was a great accompaniment to the book if you want to check it out.

Here are some excerpts I loved.

> "He spends much of that first day gazing out the window, like a cat. He planned to go west immediately, but it's so easy to linger in Halifax, where he falls prey to a personal weakness he's been aware of all his life: Edwin is capable of action but prone to inertia. He likes sitting by his
window. There's a constant movement of people and ships. He doesn't want to leave, so he stays."

> "-and my point is, there's always something. I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we're living at the climax of the story. It's a kind of narcissism. We want to believe that we're uniquely important, that we're living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it's ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world."
