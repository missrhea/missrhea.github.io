What a plot! Each time I come to this book I am in awe of the simplicity and ingenuity of the plot. 12 passengers, strangers to one another in a train coach witness the murder of another man. It seems at first everyone has an alibi and no one has a motive for the victim’s murder, but Hercule Poirot charmingly discloses the truth. And in the end, the culprit is fashionably revealed and justice is served!
