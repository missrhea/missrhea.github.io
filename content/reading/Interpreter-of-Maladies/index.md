<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies">Interpreter of Maladies</a> is an excellent collection of short stories. I don't find myself gravitating towards short stories, but I had faith in this one from the get-go. Besides the Pulitzer Prize, I've steadily been enjoying Lahiri's work, hence the confidence. She does what she does best, writing about intricate human experiences with subtlety and grace. 

It is the type of book that, as a reader, renews my desire to read.

I enjoyed reading Sairam Krishnan's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/917075777?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">review</a>. He writes some of my favorite reviews.
