This is a classic Agatha Christie mystery novel. This book kept me guessing right till the end! I enjoyed the effects of the eerie poem and palpable tension in the house. Everytime I have read this book, I wish they would have paid more attention to that poem and attempted to figure out the next homicide sooner.
