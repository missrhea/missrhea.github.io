To any onlooker, I was doing something mundane but to me it was magical. The following summer I was so pumped for every single hike. The sight of snow-capped mountains, blue ocean, a bright clear sunny day instantly lifted my spirit. The first few times driving on the sea-to-sky highway I remember thinking “what a wonderful world this is”. I was also working for my internship with an awesome team and challenge. This was when the pandemic was at its height in many countries and I was acutely aware of the privilege I had.</p>\n<p>Let’s fast forward to one year later, summer 2021. To any onlooker, I should be happy. I have a full-time job, I live in a really nice place and no real problems. Except for one problem which was my idea of happiness and the lack of it. For a long time, I equated ‘not being as happy as I used to be’ with unhappiness. Until I realized my logic was flawed.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">   if (happiness today) &gt;= (happiness one year ago):\n           happy = 1\n   else: \n           happy = 0</code></pre></div>\n<p>My friend started a new job after a long struggle and two weeks ago moved into a really nice apartment with a spectacular view. I asked him what it felt like to be living in the new apartment. His reply made me re-evaluate my idea of unhappiness. He told me he’s really enjoying the new house while the feeling lasts because in about two months the happiness from this novelty will fade away.</p>\n<p>As humans, we are attracted to novelty, and when we experience something novel every single day by definition that thing is no longer a novelty. I’m sure you’ve heard the stories about the shiny new phone someone was anticipating for months that became just another device in their pocket in a few weeks. The point I’m making is that my brain-and yours-is hardwired to seek out novelty <sup>1</sup>. </p>\n<p>I’m beginning to understand that the novelty certain things held once upon a time have faded-and that is okay. So it is 100% normal that the view of the snow-covered mountains and the blue ocean doesn’t bring me as much joy as it did one year ago. That doesn’t mean that I’m not grateful enough for my life, or that I’ve lost my sense of wonder. That doesn’t mean I’m unhappy or sad.</p>\n<p>If novelty brought us happiness then the idea that the lack of novelty brings unhappiness is flawed. To put it plainly my brain is bored. I think maybe the opportunity to feel a certain amount of happiness once again lies in asking what novelty do I want to explore next? Or maybe the answer lies in looking for something other than happiness? </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup>1</sup> You can read more about how the brain is hardwired to seek out novelty <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/novelty-and-the-brain-why-new-things-make-us-feel-so-g-508983802\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reframing Unhappiness","rating":null,"date":"May 23, 2021","description":"Unlearning what it means to be unhappy."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Reframing-Unhappiness/"}}}
