The story is narrated from the boy Danny’s perspective whose boyish attitide is as petulant as it is charming. </p>\n<p>I enjoyed the way the author placed the Dutch House at the centre of this story and yet it is in the literal background of the characters Maeve and Danny’s lives for the most part. Their lives revolve around the Dutch House, grow apart and ultimatley return to it. The Dutch House starts out as the precious jewel, which goes on to become the victim of neglect and inevitibly a source of grief and finally an opportunity for reconcilliation.</p>\n<p>I found the relationship between the father and his two children to be nothing but raw and problematic for everyone involved. It is a short about a dysfunctional family, how its members can turn out alright in the end, albeit requiring an unimaginable measure of understanding and forgiveness.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Dutch House","date":"January 21, 2021","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/The Dutch House/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Remains Of The Day/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Remains Of The Day"}},"next":null}}}
