She talks about the joys of reading and the miseries of being a reader. She talks about that singular book that made you absolutely love reading not because the book was a classic or popular or critically acclaimed, but simply because you were compelled to find out what happens next. She draws parallels in how enthusiastically imposing a book you loved onto someone can be the same as unsolicited advice- both are unwelcome and unhelpful. In another chapter, she talks about the authors who earn their readers’ tears. And I could not agree more, I adore those stories because I love myself a well-earned sob story. </p>\n<p>While talking about the “Acknowledgements” section in a book Anne explains what it can reveal about the author’s journey and why she is a sucker for good “Acknowledgements” sections and why she reads it before begining any book. This resonated with me and I’m certainly going to do the same going forward.</p>\n<p>Above all else this book made me feel validated as the reader I am. I might not read as much as to label myself a bookworm. And that is okay. I can be a voracious reader whenever I find “the” book for me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I'd Rather Be Reading: The Delights and Dilemmas of the Reading Life","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"April 29, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/I'd-Rather-Be-Reading/"}}}
