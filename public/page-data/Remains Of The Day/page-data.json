Wonderful prose and a beautiful compelling story. It transported me to another time and place- I adore how the author describes the details of the British countryside mansion. The author conveys a beautiful message very subtlety through Stevens the Butler. It’s a book that touches on the themes of blind loyalty, a life spent striving for perfectionism, withholding emotions at the risk of seeming unprofessional. I truly felt for Stevens towards the end of the book. He lived his life as best he could in line with his principles and never lost sight of his life’s purpose even at the near end. A favourite line and narration of mine is towards the end and it is “the evening is the best part of the day”. This book certainly left me with a lot to reflect on.</p>\n<p>“the evening is the best part of the day”\n― Kazuo Ishiguro, The Remains of the Day</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Remains Of The Day","date":"January 21, 2021","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Remains Of The Day/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/How I make tea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My chai recipe!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/The Dutch House/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Dutch House"}}}}}
