The story is narrated from the boy Danny’s perspective whose boyish attitude delivered by Tom Hanks is as petulant as it is charming . </p>\n<p>I enjoyed the way the author placed the Dutch House at the centre of this story and yet it is in the literal background of the story. The characters Maeve and Danny’s lives revolve around the Dutch House, grow apart and inevitibly return back to it. The Dutch House starts out being potrayed as a gorgeous precious ornament which becomes the victim of neglect and a source of grief. </p>\n<p>I found the relationship between the father and his two children, Maeve and Danny raw, problematic for everyone involved. It is a story about a dysfunctional family and its members who come out fine albeit scared in the end, requiring an unimaginable measure of understanding and forgiveness.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Dutch House","date":"January 21, 2021","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Remains Of The Day/The Dutch House/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hey There!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/How I make tea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My chai recipe!"}}}}}
