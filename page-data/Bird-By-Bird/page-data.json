I know I need to write a review, but words to describe it escape me. Which is ironic because this is a book about writing which said so much so beautifully that I am at a loss of words. But to say this is a book about writing is unfair, it is so much more. And one day I will write complete this review.

I will not stop thinking about this special book. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bird By Bird","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"February 12, 2022","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Bird-By-Bird/"}}}
