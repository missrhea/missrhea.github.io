So when I stumbled across <a href=\"These Precious Days\">These Precious Days</a> I picked it up immediately. I got the audiobook and it was like listening to a dear friend talk about life. I especially remember the places I was at during certain chapters. The days I spent walking with Patchett in my ear were really special.  </p>\n<p>Patchett’s stories are intimate, full of warmth and brilliant writing. Her character development in the mere span of pages in these short stories is remarkable. With each essay, she progressively shares a bit more about her personal life. The title essay is a moving meditation on an unexpected friendship. Patchett truly opened the doors to her home, her mind, and her heart in these essays- and that is a beautiful gift for readers. </p>\n<p>I’ve procrastinated for over a month to write about <a href=\"These Precious Days\">These Precious Days</a>, hoping I could do some justice to the contents of this book. I’ve come to the conclusion that you will just have to take my word for how incredible this work is- because it truly is. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"These Precious Days","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"June 09, 2022","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/These-Precious-Days/"}}}
