My version of tea is slightly over-boiled which lends it a strong flavor. To balance this deep flavor I suggest using milk with a decent amount of fat. This really works best with loose leaf black tea (any Indian brand actually) and grated ginger. If I’m feeling fancy I might add a couple of other spices (mentioned below).   </p>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>½ cup water</li>\n<li>½ cup milk</li>\n<li>1 Tbsp loose leaf black tea</li>\n<li>½ Tbsp grated ginger (for a less intense ginger flavor, slice instead of grating)</li>\n<li>2 green cardamom pods</li>\n<li>(Some optional ingredients if you’re feeling fancy) cinnamon stick/ lemon grass stalk / a bay leaf</li>\n<li>Preferred sweetener to taste (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To a saucepan add crushed spices, water, and grated (or sliced) ginger and bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce heat slightly to medium.</li>\n<li>Add tea and milk of choice and lower heat to low. Cover and continue to simmer for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>\n<li>Then turn off the heat. Strain through a strainer and add your sweetener before serving.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This chai on a rainy day is truly a mood I hope you try if you haven’t. You can’t go wrong with pairing chai with almost anything- sweet or savoury.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My chai recipe!","date":"January 21, 2021","description":"This is not to be confused with chai-tea ☕"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/How I make tea/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hey There!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/The Dutch House/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Dutch House"}}}}}
