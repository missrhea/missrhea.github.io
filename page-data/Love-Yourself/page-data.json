Something about the platitudious ‘love yourself’ makes me want to cringe. I cringe at the title of this book and also cringe at myself for having read it. In addition, given that this book is categorized ‘self-help’ the cover is questionable to say the least. But since I have read it here is a well procrastinated review.</p>\n<p>I liked this book. I even dared to assign five stars to it, which is obviously subjective- but the bottom line is “how did reading this book make me feel?“. The combination of being a short read, picking it up at a time when I wasn’t saturated with similar content, and some degree of relatability with the author’s predicament made this book work for me. </p>\n<p>The narritive follows a familiar self-help trope. It is a short enough book to read and decide for yourself if it was helpful or not. However, if a lot of your reading consists of non-fiction self-help types perhaps you might not find this original and worthwhile.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"June 06, 2022","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Love-Yourself/"}}}
