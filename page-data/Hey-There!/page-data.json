Welcome to my little corner of the internet!</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve been working on building this website for a while. Although I will continue to make updates to the style and structure, Iâ€™m finally putting it out there. I actually enjoyed designing and builing this website because I got to revisit web development- which is a skill I abandoned for a while. What pulled me through was the copious amount of tea (read: <a href=\"https://rhearodrigues.me/How-I-make-tea/\">chai</a>) and baked treats I had on the side.</p>\n<p>This is where I plan to share a little bit of what Iâ€™m up to. Iâ€™m going to keep this one short, so thank you for stopping by, and maybe Iâ€™ll see you here again soon.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hey There!","rating":null,"date":"January 01, 2021","description":"Nice to see you here ðŸ˜Š"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Hey-There!/"}}}
