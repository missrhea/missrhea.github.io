In this short pocket-sized book Kingwell examines risk, how society should manage and distribute risk with a focus on the covid-19 era. This book is so short yet I had a hard time summarizing it. But I will update this review when I get to summarizing it.</p>\n<h1>🎨 Impressions</h1>\n<p>Right off the bat the book is not easy reading. One of the reviews on the cover says “Kingwell is well-read, a gifter notice, a lively writer…” and I could not agree more. The footnotes were interesting and I think this might be the only book where I read all the footnotes. Although I learned about risk, luck, and politics of risk I also learned a lot about the author’s likes and dislikes- which frankly made the book a bit more interesting.</p>\n<h1>🕵 How I Discovered It</h1>\n<p>Browsing the library shelves.</p>\n<h1>✍️ My Favorite Quotes</h1>\n<p>(to be updated)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On Risk","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"October 28, 2021","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/On-Risk/"}}}
