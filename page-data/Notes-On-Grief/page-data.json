It is a compilation of short essays as she grapples with the sudden loss of her father in the chaotic summer of the 2020 covid-19 pandemic. </p>\n<p>It feels strange to comment on what is clearly a deeply personal memoir for the author. Yet, I can’t help but say that it is a beautiful and evocative piece of literature, that it achieved its goal for me as the reader. I felt the big and uncomfortable emotions. Throughout the book, I either had a smile on my face or I had fat tears streaming down my cheeks. That is <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19992417.Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie\">Adichie’s</a> mastery of the language along with the fierce love for her father.</p>\n<p>The human condition unites us in our consideration of death and the loss of loved ones, which is what makes <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57032570-notes-on-grief\">Notes on Grief </a> universal. </p>\n<p>I began reading this book in January when I was at home in India. Then, all of a sudden I lost somebody very dear to me and my family. And it was difficult to continue reading this book. So I picked it up again last weekend. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57032570-notes-on-grief\">Notes on Grief </a> was the first book I read by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19992417.Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie\">Adichie</a>.  And I will be coming back for more of her work. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes On Grief","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"April 11, 2022","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Notes-On-Grief/"}}}
