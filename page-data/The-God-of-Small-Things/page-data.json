It’s filled with vivid and intricate detail and her writing paints portraits of the characters with all their beauty and mess. She uses clever metaphors that can transport you into the characters shoes.</p>\n<p>Although I loved this book after I completed it, in the beginning I wanted to give it up. The beginning is muddled with a dozen characters and flashbacks to events that have flashbacks to other events and then back to the present. I’m glad I pushed through because the story is worth it in the end.</p>\n<p>These are two of my favorite quotes from the book. In the context of the story these quotes hit me hard.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That’s what careless words do. They make people love you a little less.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. To never get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple. To respect strength, never power. Above all, to watch. To try and understand. To never look away. And never, never to forget.”</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"The God of Small Things","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"December 20, 2018","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/The-God-of-Small-Things/"}}}
