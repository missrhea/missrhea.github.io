I urge you to pick this book up, read it with careful consideration, and use it to determine your relationship with social media going forward. </p>\n<p>Personally, I have several reasons for giving up most of my social media use and controlling the social media I continue to use, but the bottom line is that it made me <i>feel bad</i>- I realized I had to remove myself from that situation. Some might say this reaction is too strong.

If you want to do a <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/8430423/social-media-teachers-students-youth\">hurting society</a> some good evaluate your dynamic with social media and start with this book.</p>\n<p>A friend had mentioned one of Lanier’s <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget\">books</a> in the past. When I saw this book on the first shelf in the library I <i>had</i> to pick it up, and I’m so glad I did.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"March 10, 2022","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Ten-Arguments-for-Deleting-Your-Social-Media/"}}}
