It hugely motivated this blog.</p>\n<h3>How I WISH the Book Changed Me:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It made me more <strong>comfortable with sharing</strong> my thoughts and my work online.</li>\n<li>I plan to write and publish articles and <strong>stop being afraid</strong> of what “some” people might think, there is surely someone who will benefit from my work- and I will think of these people.</li>\n<li>Self-promotion matters. Period. And I plan to <strong>advocate for and promote myself</strong> (because if I don’t then nobody will).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>I WISH My Top 3 Takeaways were:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I had a professor in college who returned our graded essays, walked up to the chalkboard, and wrote in huge letters: <strong>“SO WHAT?”</strong> She threw the piece of chalk down and said, “Ask yourself that every time you turn in a piece of writing.” It’s a lesson I never forgot. Always be sure to run everything you share with others through The “So What?” Test.</li>\n<li>If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one.</li>\n<li>The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online.** Use pictures, words, and video. Take people step-by-step through part of your process. As blogger Kathy Sierra says, **“make people better at something they want to be better at”</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered","rating":"⭐⭐⭐⭐","date":"January 21, 2021","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Show-Your-Work!/"}}}
