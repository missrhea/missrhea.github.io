Iâ€™m using Gatsby as the static site generator and GitHub pages for hosting this website. Iâ€™ve been working on setting up this website for a while and Iâ€™m finally putting it out here.

Iâ€™m more sure than not about how this website is presently set up. I might have to tweak something at some point. Right now Iâ€™m content to start from here.</p>\n<p>This is where I plan to share a little bit of what Iâ€™m up to. Iâ€™m going to keep this one short, so thank you for stopping by, and maybe Iâ€™ll see you here again soon. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hey There!","date":"January 21, 2021","description":"Welcome to my little corner of the internet ðŸ˜Š"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/How I make tea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My chai recipe!"}}}}}
