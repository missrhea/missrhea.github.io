When this began the emotions were intense and stayed with me for prolonged intervals. Sometimes I couldn’t shake the feeling for months. These days something on the internet might “trigger” that feeling for me. But it is milder and I’m able to snap out of it quicker.</p>\n<p>The emotions I’m referring to have to do with the experience of a deep loss. The kind of loss that strips away your identity. In the aftermath of which one is torn between unwanted inexorable reinvention and the holding onto of the loss.</p>\n<p>A huge portion of my identity was devoted to being a student. That meant I genuinely enjoyed going to class, making notes, working on assignments, discussions with peers and professors, and taking tests. I derived a lot of satisfaction, joy, meaning, and purpose as a student. I was ecstatic to be in my Masters program in a area that truly excited me. It was a everything to me. I loved being pushed to my limits on challenging assignments by my professors even though in the moment it seemed stressful and undoable. I loved how students would organize themselves to discuss the test once it was completed. I loved the process of interviewing for internships. I’m not sorry, I just really enjoyed interviewing at that time. There was such possibility as I looked at postings for the open roles.</p>\n<p>In December 2019 I accepted the internship for what was supposed to be a 4 month long hackathon / case competition in Toronto the summer of 2020. To say I was looking forward to that experience would have been an understatement. I knew this was my one and only window to experience being an intern, so this meant a lot to me. </p>\n<p>Winter turned to spring and on 1 February 2020 as the Diamond Princess was quarantined in Okinawa the world I was excitedly looking forward to disappeared over night. At the time I couldn’t have fathomed that a far away procedural quarantine of a cruise ship off the coast of Japan would derail my plans and alter the course of my own life and a million others. </p>\n<p>Now, something I learned in therapy was to stop disqualifying my feelings because somebody else has it worse. So I realize the immense toll that the virus has had in different ways. This is my story.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"February","rating":null,"date":"February 12, 2023","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/February/"}}}
