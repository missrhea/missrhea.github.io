Murty writes without fuss and despite the simplicity, it is poignant.  </p>\n<p>A friend recommended this book. I read it on a 15-hour long flight swapping it every now and then for <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92922919-rhea#\">The Little Prince</a>, meals, and naps. I couldn’t wait to land so I could look up a picture of the Bakula flower and confirm whether or not I had seen it before- I hadn’t. Gently Falls The Bakula is more than a cozy story, it reminded me of an important lesson- to choose for ourselves what brings meaning to our life and pursue that whole-heartedly. This quote sums it up.</p>\n<p>“‘Shrimati, what are you thinking of?’ ‘My loneliness. Sometimes it is very depressing.’ ‘Shrimati, may I give you some advice? Hope you will not mind. One should have the basic happiness within oneself. That happiness comes from the kind of work one does whole-heartedly.‘”</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gently Falls The Bakula","rating":"⭐⭐⭐","date":"November 24, 2021","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Gently-Falls-The-Bakula/"}}}
