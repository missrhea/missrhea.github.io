That’s 27 trips around the Sun, which is really a lot of distance to have covered, both metaphorically and literally. For my last three birthdays, I’ve had the idea of reflecting on my journey. And, each year I have begun to write only to abandon it. But this year, this year I’m going to go through with it. No amount of perfectionism, negative self-talk, doubt, laziness, or fear will hold me back this time. This is going to be an exercise in imperfection, positive self-talk, confidence, childlike eagerness, and fearlessness.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve started to do this thing that’s become a little game I play with myself. I try to put a positive spin on a situation. Here’s how it began: I was at the hairdresser with my friend, who had been going to him for the past six years. Her hairdresser was super friendly and joking about how demanding she is and how specific her requests are. Then I said, “That’s a great thing because she knows exactly what she wants!” I mentioned that I hadn’t figured out my preferences yet. The hairdresser laughed and said it was the most positive take on a situation he’s ever heard. So, I decided to keep playing this game with myself.</p>\n<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but on the days leading up to my birthday and the days right after my birthday, I become contemplative. Some thoughts and feelings are good; I tend to feel more grateful at this time. At the same time, there are thoughts and feelings that bring me down. So, I decided to come up with a positive spin on this thought: I’m turning a year older, and my life seems harder than ever before. I’ve chosen to look at it as though I’m the protagonist in the movie of my life, and this is the part where the plot gets complex and mysterious. The lights are low, and the background score is unsettling. But, as in the movies, it won’t remain this way forever. This is where things get interesting; it’s the protagonist’s opportunity to develop depth and character. This is the part where the plot thickens. That’s my positive take on some aspects of my life right now. </p>\n<p>As I slowly but surely inch my way to my 28th year, I’ll take the metaphorical basket of lemons life’s handed me and make the best lemonade I can. But if it doesn’t work out and sometimes it won’t work out, then like Miranda Lambert sings in Bluebird, “I’ll just mix ‘em in my drink”. *Cheers*.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Plot Thickens","rating":null,"date":"October 10, 2023","description":"Growing older in age could use a shift in perspective."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/The-Plot-Thickens/"}}}
